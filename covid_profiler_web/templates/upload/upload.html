	Upload your next sequencing data in <b>fasta</b> format. Files will
	be processed using the tb-profiler pipeline with default parameters. You may
	select the technology used to generate the data (Illumina or Oxford Nanopore).
	Samples will be process with a first in first out policy so please be patient
	as there may be runs waiting to be processed before yours.

</div>
<div class="pb-4">
    <b>Please note:</b> at the moment we can only accomodate uploads of under 1GB.
    If you have files which are larger or you require many	isolates to be processed
    and have access to a linux or osX operating system then	it might be worthwhile
    to run the commandline version of tb-profiler. For more information on this please visit the
	<a href="https://github.com/jodyphelan/TBProfiler/">github repository</a>.
